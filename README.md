## Issues
Everything needed to be worked on will be created as an issue. you can check the progress of an issue in the projects tab where it will say to do, in progress, or done. To check progress more in depth we should be leaving comments on the issue when we make any new development with the issue so then people can look inside the issue to see where its at. 

### Please use branches
If you need to make a change to anyone elses work please create it as a branch so nothing breaks randomly and we spend a day trying to figure it out.
